# 0x02-ES6_classes

Welcome to the `0x02-ES6_classes` repository. This repository contains a collection of JavaScript programs that showcase the use of ES6 classes.

## Introduction

ES6 classes introduced a new way to define classes and constructor functions in JavaScript, making it more structured and easier to work with object-oriented programming. This repository provides examples and exercises to help you understand and practice working with ES6 classes in JavaScript.

## Program Descriptions

1. [0-classroom.js](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-javascript/blob/main/0x02-ES6_classes/0-classroom.js): This program defines a `Classroom` class with methods for adding students and getting the list of students.

2. [1-make_classrooms.js](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-javascript/blob/main/0x02-ES6_classes/1-make_classrooms.js): This program demonstrates the creation of multiple `Classroom` instances and interaction with them.

3. [2-hbtn_course.js](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-javascript/blob/main/0x02-ES6_classes/2-hbtncourse.js): This program defines an `HBTNCourse` class with methods for setting and getting values.

4. [3-currency.js](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-javascript/blob/main/0x02-ES6_classes/3-currency.js): This program defines a `Currency` class with methods for converting and displaying currency.

5. [4-pricing.js](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-javascript/blob/main/0x02-ES6_classes/4-pricing.js): This program demonstrates the use of a `Pricing` class to calculate and display prices.

6. [5-building.js](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-javascript/blob/main/0x02-ES6_classes/5-building.js): This program defines a `Building` class and subclasses for different types of buildings.

7. [6-sky_high.js](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-javascript/blob/main/0x02-ES6_classes/6-sky_high.js): This program demonstrates the creation of different types of buildings and their usage.

8. [7-airport.js](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-javascript/blob/main/0x02-ES6_classes/7-airport.js): This program defines an `Airport` class with methods for managing flights.

9. [8-hbtn_class.js](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-javascript/blob/main/0x02-ES6_classes/8-hbtn_class.js): This program showcases a `HBTNClass` class with various properties and methods.

10. [9-hoisting.js](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-javascript/blob/main/0x02-ES6_classes/9-hoisting.js): This program explores variable hoisting behavior in JavaScript.

11. [10-car.js](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-javascript/blob/main/0x02-ES6_classes/10-car.js): This program defines a `Car` class and demonstrates its usage with different methods and properties.

These programs cover various aspects of ES6 classes and JavaScript concepts. Feel free to explore them to enhance your understanding of ES6 in JavaScript.


## Compiling and Executing

To run these JavaScript programs, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the program you want to run.

3. Use the Node.js runtime to execute the program. Replace `program.js` with the name of the JavaScript file you want to run:

   ```bash
   node program.js
   ```

  For example, to run `0-classroom.js`, you would use:

  ```bash
  node 0-classroom.js
  ```
