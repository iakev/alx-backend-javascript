6. [5-http.js](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-javascript/blob/main/0x05-Node_JS_basic/5-http.js): Builds a more advanced HTTP server with routing.

7. [6-http_express.js](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-javascript/blob/main/0x05-Node_JS_basic/6-http_express.js): Introduces Express.js, a popular Node.js web application framework, and sets up a basic server.

8. [7-http_express.js](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-javascript/blob/main/0x05-Node_JS_basic/7-http_express.js): Continues with Express.js by adding routes and handling HTTP requests.

## Compiling and Executing

To compile and execute the Node.js scripts in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Node.js script you want to run.

3. Use the following command to execute the script, replacing `script.js` with the actual script filename:

   ```bash
   node script.js
   ```

For example, to run `0-console.js`, you would use:

```bash
node 0-console.js
```

Repeat this process for other scripts.
