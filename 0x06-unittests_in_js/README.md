# JavaScript Unit Tests - alx-backend-javascript

Welcome to the JavaScript Unit Tests repository of alx-backend-javascript. This repository contains a collection of JavaScript programs focusing on unit testing using various testing frameworks and libraries. Whether you're new to unit testing or looking to expand your skills, you'll find useful examples and resources here.

## Introduction

Unit testing is an essential part of software development that involves testing individual units or components of a program to ensure they function as expected. This repository serves as a practical guide to unit testing in JavaScript.

## Program Descriptions

Here are the JavaScript unit testing programs included in this repository:

- **API Testing 1**: An example of API testing using Mocha and Chai.

- **API Testing 2**: An example of API testing using Jest.

- **API Testing 3**: An example of API testing using Jasmine.

- **calcul.js**: A basic JavaScript program for performing calculations.

- **calcul.test.js**: Unit tests for the `calcul.js` program.

- **calcul_chai.js**: The same calculation program with Chai assertions.

- **calcul_chai.test.js**: Unit tests for the `calcul_chai.js` program.

- **payment.js**: A program for handling payment processing.

- **payment.test.js**: Unit tests for the `payment.js` program.

- **payment_token.js**: A program for managing payment tokens.

- **payment_token.test.js**: Unit tests for the `payment_token.js` program.

- **skip.test.js**: A program with skipped unit tests.

## Compiling and Executing

To run unit tests for these programs, you'll need to set up a testing environment and use a testing framework or library like Mocha, Jest, or Jasmine. Follow these general steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the program and test files.

3. Install the necessary testing dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

Run the unit tests using your chosen testing framework:

```bash
npm test
```
